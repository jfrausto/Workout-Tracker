## Installation

Visit the application with [this](https://wicked-scarecrow-09377.herokuapp.com/) deployed heroku link.

## Usage

Upon loading the application, you will be presented with the last recorded workout. From here you can add a new workout, or continue tracking the one displayed. In both cases, you will be taken to a screen that allows you to add a new exercise from a series of drop down menus. Your workout will be added and when you get taken back to the home page you will be able to see your new stats from the workout. When you click on the stats page, you will be able to see a beautiful representation of your workout metadata!
